LeetCode solutions collection

This folder will contain C++ solutions to LeetCode problems. Each solution file is named with the problem title and a short description in the header.

Usage:
- Add a new `.cpp` file for each problem.
- Each file should compile standalone with a simple main (optional) or be suitable for LeetCode submission.
